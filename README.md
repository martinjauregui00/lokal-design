This website is a local network of artists, designers, suppliers, curators, etc., to show and expand the Basque art network and ensure greater participation at the local level.
On this platform we find a catalog with different categories in which companies or people interested in recruiting people for a project have access to data and portfolios of artists or creative entities that are based in Bilbao.
Additionally, there is the possibility, by logging in, to post your profile in the category you consider appropriate and this is added to the database and displayed in the catalog.
